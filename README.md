#Rust compiler project.

I decided learn rust, language VM, and developement besed on the android phone in my free time when I am under the beedsheet trying to put to sleep my kids to sleep. 
So, I've set up working developement environemt on my phone and trying to learn something new one step at a time. 

If you have tried to develop code using your phone any inputs would be valueable!
Feel free to create issue in this repo.
